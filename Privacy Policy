Monitor app performance and troubleshoot issues.
Improve app features and design based on usage patterns.
Provide insights to help us understand user preferences.
3. Information Sharing and Disclosure

Octane Pro does not sell, trade, or otherwise share your information with third parties, except as necessary to provide and improve our services or as required by law. We may share anonymized or aggregated data that does not personally identify you.

4. Data Security

We are committed to protecting your data. We implement security measures to safeguard the information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, please note that no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.

5. Third-Party Services
